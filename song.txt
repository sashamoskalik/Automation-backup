Live Fast

Алан Уокер, A$AP Rocky

Live fast for the moment
Keep burning on both ends
I gotta get out 'fore I die, out 'fore I die
Get out 'fore I die
Blacked out in the morning
Too high, never cave in
I gotta get out 'fore I die' out 'fore I die
Get out 'fore I die
Burning like a candle both ends dripping spills loose
Ends burn heads burning end bridges
Better use the stairs 'til your legs hurting
Running for the hills I'm on their heels keep their heads turning
Consider it a fair warning
My partners steady moving like it's feds on us, uh uh
Probably 'cause you assuming that it's meds on us, uh uh
Kick big shit I need leg warmers, chug water, all love
Blood is thicker than the dreads on us (woo)
Now I remember that when I'm in my bag
It ain't where you from, it's where you're at
Where them niggas at
Time to toe tag, yeah, body bag, yeah
Karate chop the shit in half 'til they find my match (fight)
'Til they find me laying dead on my back
This could be my last year
Putting up a fight until I collapse, yeah
2013 I went wild for the night
In 2019 I'm getting out 'fore I die
Live fast for the moment (yeah)
Keep burning on both ends
I gotta get out 'fore I die' out 'fore I die
Get out 'fore I die (yeah, uh)
Blacked out in the morning
Too high, never cave in
I gotta get out 'fore I die, out 'fore I die
Get out 'fore I die
